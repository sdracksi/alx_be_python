Exercise 2: Namespace Exploration Instruction:

Create a Python script with two functions, each defining a variable with the same name but with different purposes (e.g., count variable in a counting function and a logging function).
Call both functions and print the variable inside each function, observing how namespaces keep variables separate within functions
